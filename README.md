Most of files for 3D printing can be found- https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1015238.
Others, including magnetic attachment and blocks are in /models. 

Grid was drawn on paper, each square is a little bit larger than a size of a box. Small magnets and washers should suffice for picking up blocks.
